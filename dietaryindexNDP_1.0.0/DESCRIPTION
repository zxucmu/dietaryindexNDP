Description: 
    This R package was developed based on the DII_NHANES_FPED() from the R package 'dietaryindex'. The calculation of the DII incorporates garlic, ginger, onion, pepper, and oregano/thyme in addition to the components used in the DII_NHANES_FPED function for NHANES participants. Additionally, the intakes of flavan-3-ols, flavones, flavonols, flavonones, anthocyanidins, and isoflavones are included for participants from NHANES 2007-2010 and 2017-2018. 
    The calculation of the DII consists of three steps
    1. The first step is flattening the FNDDSSRLinks or FNDDSIngred file.
    2. The second step involves calculating the intakes of garlic, ginger, onion, pepper, thyme and oregano, as well as isoflavones, anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, flavanones, flavones and flavonols for specific NHANES survey periods.
    3. In the third step, the DII is calculated based on components such as alcohol, vitamins (B12, B6, A, C, D, E), Î²-carotene, caffeine, carbohydrates, cholesterol, energy, fiber, folic acid, iron, magnesium, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), niacin, n-6 fatty acids, protein, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), riboflavin, saturated fat, selenium, thiamin, zinc, garlic, ginger, onion, pepper, thyme, and oregano. It is also advisable to include isoflavones, anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, flavanones, flavones, and flavonols for participants of NHANES 2007-2008, 2009-2010 or 2017-2018.
